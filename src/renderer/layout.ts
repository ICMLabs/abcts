 * wrote one — where `Accidental.natural` is 0, which is falsy. So the idiomatic
 * `if (pitch.accidental)` collapses "inherit from the key" and "explicitly natural",
 * which are musically opposite: in D major, `=F` is F natural and a bare `F` is F sharp.
 * Writing it that way silently drops every natural sign in the corpus and is wrong in
 * every key but C major. This is risk 5 in CHECKPOINT-2026-07-18.
 *
 * ABC prints an accidental exactly where the source wrote one — that is the notation's
 * convention and why this needs no key or measure state. A note inheriting a sharp from
 * the key signature prints nothing, which is what `null` already says.
